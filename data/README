annotations with appropriate Name=unique_id tag in the 9th column, to use with "-n Name"

Arabidopsis thaliana annotation in version TAIR10, and includes the curated MITE annotations as published in Henaff et al 2014, Plant Journal

Human annotations are in version hg19, and have been divided up by chromosome -- this is to circumvent the file size limit imposed by github. Use

cat hg19* > hg19.te_annots.gff 

to combine them.
